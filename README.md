# Tile Matching Game

Reference: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UcfBfSP2T4

The user should be able to select a tile, see it's contents, and then attempt to match it

If failed, the tiles are flipped back over, but the positions do not change

Psuedocode/Notes

- array of objects to keep track of tile value, flipped & matched
- might complicate needing to check if game has been completed (all tiles have been matched), but that was not clarified in the requirements
